SOW 1.4: AI Driven Module SDLC Framework: 

Objectives:  

Organizations struggle with inconsistent, unreliable infrastructure module development that slows delivery and increases operational risk. Development teams face challenges with module quality, testing, versioning, and lifecycle management, leading to duplicated effort, security vulnerabilities, and reduced confidence in production deployments. 

 

This engagement will establish a comprehensive module development lifecycle that accelerates infrastructure automation delivery while ensuring reliability, security, and maintainability. The solution will enable development teams to confidently create, test, and release infrastructure modules with automated quality gates, reducing time-to-production and operational overhead. 

 

Activities:  

 

1. Module Development Framework (MDF): 

- Establish GitHub PR automation and policy checks for best practices. 

- Configure AI-assisted code review for security, composability & semantics. 

- Design module ownership model and contributor guidelines. 

- Set up publishing pipelines to XDSOW1-4-compliant module registries. 

- Enable module metadata management, tagging, and discovery. 

- Publish guidelines on module composability, input/output contracts, and reusability. 

- Enforce pre-commit and pre-push hooks with linting, validation, and formatting rules. 

- Publish developer documentation for consuming, contributing, and extending modules. 

- Generate interface contracts and schema documentation (e.g., using JSON schema or tfdoc). 



2. Module Testing Framework (MTF): 

- Design reusable test harness for OpenTofu modules (using terratest, etc.). 

- Implement unit, integration, and compliance tests per module. 

- Integrate scanning tools (e.g., tfsec, checkov) into CI pipelines. 

- Automate environment provisioning and teardown for test executions. 

- Capture test coverage, runtime metrics, and regression failures. 

- Module Release Framework (MRF): 

- Implement semantic versioning with Git tag-based triggers. 

- Automate changelog generation and release notes via commit history and PR labels. 

- Configure module release note generation. 

- Publish modules to internal/external registries with release promotion stages (alpha → stable). 

- Validate release artifacts against compliance and security baselines. 



3. Module Support Framework (MSF): 

- Define issue tracking and triage workflows. 

- Enable structured bug reporting templates and diagnostic info capture. 

- Integrate observability hooks for module telemetry (if runtime applicable). 

- Automated response routing for support issues via labels or code owners. 

- Establish module deprecation and lifecycle policies. 

 

 

 

Outcomes:  

- End-to-end documentation for Module SDLC, versioning, and contribution workflow. 

- GitHub template repositories with embedded MDF, MTF, MRF, and MSF capabilities. 

- AI-integrated PR automation rulesets for development and review. 

- Pre-built CI/CD pipelines for testing, releasing, and publishing modules. 

- Module design patterns library with examples of reusable, production-ready tofu modules. 

- Changelog automation, tagging conventions, and release audit trail. 

- Developer onboarding guide and coding standards for module authors. 

- Support playbook for triage, issue resolution, and lifecycle management. 

 

Deliverables:  

- Module Development Framework implementation - GitHub repository templates and automation 

- Module Testing Framework - Testing Framework and CI/CD pipeline configurations 

- Module Release Framework - Semantic versioning automation and registry publishing workflows 

- Module Support Framework - Issue tracking templates and triage automation 

- AI-powered code review integration - Security and compliance scanning automation 

- Developer documentation package - Contribution guidelines, coding standards, and onboarding guide 

- End-to-end SDLC documentation - Complete workflow documentation from development to retirement 

 

 

Assumptions:  

- XDSOW1-4 maintains GitHub Enterprise or GitHub.com organization with administrative access for infrastructure team to configure and test the frameworks. 

- Development teams have Git workflow proficiency and containerized development environment access 

- XDSOW1-4 provides dedicated squad for framework adoption, training and change management 

- Existing infrastructure module registry is available or new registry is established. 

- Security and compliance requirements are documented and available for integration 

- Client approves AI-assisted code review tools and associated data processing agreements 

 

 

Out Of Scope:  

 

- Migration of existing legacy modules to new framework standards 

- Training beyond documentation and onboarding guides provided 

- Custom module development for specific business use cases in this SoW 

- Infrastructure provisioning or modification of existing cloud environments 

- Integration with external ticketing systems beyond GitHub Issues 

- Performance optimization of existing infrastructure or cost analysis 

- Compliance framework definition or security policy creation 

 

 

Squad: 

 

- 1 Platform Engineer (Intuitive) 

- 1 Principal Platform Engineer (Intuitive) 

- 1 Platform Archiect (XDSOW1-4)
